# Multilayer graph analysis of insulin and the brain

## Introduction
Although we know that the caudate1, insula2, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)2, hippocampus3, amygdala4, and putamen1 are sensitive to peripheral insulin, it is unknown how these regions response to insulin kinetics independently nor together. The present analysis uses a simultaneous hyperglycemic clamp and resting state fMRI to assess how the brain communicates when peripheral insulin is changing.

## Methods
* 60-minute  concurrent hyperglycemic clamp and resting state functional MRI.
* Participants (n=8) had normal beta-cell function (HbA1c<5.7%; 28 y± 4.6).
* Figure 1A. Imaging data was registered to the participants
* Figure 1B. A custom algorithm to create a boxcar model (1, 0, or -1) of the insulin time course
* Figure 1C. Natural visibility graphs from the timeseries. A natural visibility graph describes the relationship between timepoints in a subject’s ROI.
* Figure 1D. Multiplex network. In a multiplex network we compare the relationships between the same node (here a timepoint) between brain regions (ROIs = layers).
* Tested layer entanglement (a measurement of how important a node is between layers), homogeneity (how many nodes are connected between layers), and modularity (which nodes are most similar).

This is the inital analysis for an obesity society abstract. This is a very beta analysis.
